- My bluenose permissions are not set properly, therefore I also submitted through Brightspace and GitHub if you're not able to view my assignment. 

- To run the code: 
Download the file (WebCrawler) and save it into Eclipse's workspace. 
Run it through eclipse (or any other java comfier used)
There are no specific running instructions to follow, it runs as a smoke java code :)
